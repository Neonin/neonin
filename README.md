A former <b>SEO specialist</b> who became a front-end dev just to show the former niche fellow experts how the correct code should look like. I <b>enjoy studying management</b> and marketing as that type of proficiency makes it possible to understand the customer and deliver the results that meet both his requirements and user involvement. Improving personal productivity and automating routine tasks is my favorite hobby.
